Linux Machine Image Setup with Packer (Python 3.9 Compatible)

This guide walks you through creating a custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI) on Linux with Python 3.9 pre-installed, using HashiCorp Packer.
Requirements
1. Setting Up Your AWS Account

Before you begin, make sure you have an IAM user configured for Packer access:
Step 1: Create an IAM User

    Sign in to the AWS Console.

    Go to IAM (Identity and Access Management).

    Select Users > Add user.

    Set a username (e.g., packer-user) and enable Programmatic access.

Step 2: Assign IAM Policies

Attach the following policies:

    AmazonEC2FullAccess

    AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore

    AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess (optional)

Download and save your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
Step 3: Configure AWS CLI

    Install the AWS CLI:

sudo apt install awscli  # Ubuntu
brew install awscli      # macOS

Set up credentials:

    aws configure

2. Install Packer and AWS CLI

To get started, install both tools on your machine:
Linux/macOS

brew install packer       # macOS
sudo apt install packer   # Ubuntu

Alternatively, use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL): WSL Screenshot
Why AWS CLI Is Needed

    Authentication: Easily handle credentials.

    Permissions: Manage IAM roles and policies.

    AWS Services Integration: Interacts with EC2, SSM, S3, etc.

To confirm it's working:

packer version

3. Create the Packer Template (bakery.json)

Below is a Packer template to set up a basic AMI with Python 3.9:

{
  "variables": {
    "aws_region": "us-east-1"
  },
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "amazon-ebs",
      "region": "{{user `aws_region`}}",
      "source_ami": "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0",
      "instance_type": "t2.micro",
      "ssh_username": "ubuntu",
      "ami_name": "custom-python39-{{timestamp}}"
    }
  ],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "shell",
      "inline": [
        "sudo apt-get update",
        "sudo apt-get install -y python3.9 python3.9-venv python3.9-dev"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

4. Validate the Template

Run the following commands in the directory where bakery.json is saved:

packer init .
packer validate bakery.json

If there are no errors, you're ready to build.

5. Build the AMI

To create your image, run:

packer build bakery.json

The process will take a few minutes. At the end, you'll receive the AMI ID for your new image.

6. Launch an Instance Using Your Image
On AWS

    Go to EC2 Console > AMIs.

    Locate your new AMI.

    Launch an EC2 instance from it.

Final Notes

This process ensures that every environment starts with a consistent Linux setup including Python 3.9. It helps streamline deployments and reduce configuration issues.

If you'd prefer a Docker-based image setup instead, feel free to ask! ðŸš€
